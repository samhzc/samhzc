    <div class="text_headings">Project: Employment Data Physicalization</div>
    <div class="text_subheadings">Aim and Purpose</div>
    <div>To visually represent the employed population growth rates of different time periods using a tangible medium. By creating a physical representation of the data, it could help people better understand and engage with the information, also it is a way to create a more memorable and impactful way of conveying the data. This physicalization can also highlight patterns or trends in the data, or draw attention to particular time periods or geographic areas where the growth rates were particularly high or low. Additionally, this physicalization could be used to facilitate discussion and analysis of the data, either by individuals or groups, in order to gain deeper insights and understanding about the employed population growth rates in the different time periods.The data set can be downloaded directly from https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/employment-labour/labour-market-statistics the second link under the heading Annual Average on the web page. It requires the ability to access .xls files in order to open the downloaded data set.</div>
    <div class="text_subheadings">Dataset Modification</div>
    <div>This is the modification of the original dataset to show the employed population growth rate in percentage of each year intervals.</div>

    <div class="text_subheadings">Motivation</div>
    <div>The motivation of this physicalization is to help people understand the data more easily and to inspire creativity in relation to the data. As a creativity support tool, this physicalization could help people in a specific creative task such as identifying areas for future research related to employment growth. For example, it could help people identify regions or time periods where there was a significant change in employment growth rate compared to other regions or time periods. By using colors or shapes to represent different regions and LED lights of different colors represent change in the growth rate, people could easily see where the most significant changes occurred. This could be particularly useful for researchers who are trying to identify factors that contribute to employment growth or decline. By using this physicalization as a tool to visualize the data, they may be able to identify regions or time periods where additional research is needed to better understand the factors contributing to employment growth. In addition, this physicalization could also be used as a tool for brainstorming or generating new ideas related to employment growth. Overall, this interactable physicalization could be used as a CST to help people, especially policy makers and researchers, in their works by helping them brainstorm and giving them more creative ideas. By interacting with this CST, people can look at the dataset from different angles thus increasing their creativity to conduct further research about this dataset.</div>
    <div class="text_subheadings">How Does This Physicalization Work</div>
    <div>The interactable physicalization of the employed population growth rate dataset allows users to interact with the physicalization by using an IR remote control. The physicalization consists of a 2D map model of British Columbia, which is divided into three regions. Each region has three LED lights that correspond to the growth rate of the employed population in that region. The LED lights change color based on the growth rate of the employed population in that region, with red indicating a growth rate of above 7%, yellow indicating a growth rate between 0% and 7%, and green indicating a negative growth rate.</div>
    <div>To interact with the physicalization, users can press buttons on an IR remote control. Pressing button 1 on the remote control will display the growth rate of the employed population from 1995 to 2000. Pressing button 2 will display the growth rate of the employed population from 2000 to 2005. Pressing button 3 will display the growth rate of the employed population from 2005 to 2010. Pressing button 4 will display the growth rate of the employed population from 2010 to 2015. Pressing button 5 will display the growth rate of the employed population from 2015 to 2020. British Columbia is divided into three big regions, Vancouver Island/Coast & Mainland/Southwest, Thompson/Okanagan & Kootenay, Cariboo & Nechako & Northeast.</div>
    <div>When a user presses a button on the IR remote control, the corresponding LED lights will light up on the 2D map model of British Columbia, indicating the growth rate of the employed population in that region for the selected time period. If a user presses any other button on the remote control, a message will be displayed on the physicalization, indicating that the wrong button was pressed and asking the user to re-enter their selection.</div>
    <div>This interactable physicalization provides a hands-on, visual and interactive way for users to explore and understand the employed population growth rate dataset. It allows users to quickly and easily see the growth rate of the employed population in different regions of British Columbia for different time periods, and to compare and contrast the growth rates between different regions and time periods. It is also a fun and engaging way to learn about data and to stimulate curiosity and interest in the topic of employment growth.</div>

    <div class="text_subheadings">Future Works</div>
    <div>Some future works may include:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>Test the physicalization with users: To evaluate how effective this physicalization is at conveying information and supporting creativity, it could be helpful to conduct user testing with a diverse group of participants. This could involve observing how people interact with the physicalization, asking them questions about the information it presents, and soliciting feedback on how it could be improved.</li>
        <li>Incorporate additional data: If additional data becomes available in the future, it could be incorporated into the physicalization to provide a more comprehensive view of employment trends in British Columbia. For example, data on specific industries or occupations could be added to the map to help viewers understand where employment growth is happening within the province.</li>
        <li>Explore other data visualizations: While the physicalization described here uses a 2D map and LED lights to convey information, there are many other ways to visualize data physically. For example, the data could be represented using physical objects (such as a set of stacked blocks) or using different materials to represent different growth rates. Exploring these other approaches could help identify additional ways to convey complex information in a tangible, interactive way.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>TIPs:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>To turn on the LED screen, use a potentiometer. Adjust the potentiometer to turn up the LED screen. Once the LED screen is turned on, you should see the text print out.</li>
        <li>Use Female-to-Male DuPont Wires to extend the LEDs, IR Receiver Module, Potentiometer and the LCD1602 Module.</li>
