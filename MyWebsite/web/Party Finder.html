    <div class="text_subheadings">Project Proposal</div>
    <div>We are planning on making an app or plugin to help people find others to play with for online video games. This would take the form of some sort of interface where people could input some information about themselves, and be matched with another person who is similar to them.</div>
    <div>In this day and age, more people than ever are spending their free time playing video games (Kirkcaldy). Many of these people, therefore, may be looking for others to play with. “Children and teens are spending more and more time playing video games online with their friends. For most, this is a positive experience, allowing them to communicate with others even when they are unable to physically be with them. This is particularly true for people with difficulty spending time with others in-person, like those with major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder” (Fishman). Additionally, playing games with friends is super fun, and any way this could be made easier would be great.</div>
    <div>Some possible HCI based solutions to this problem are matching people based on their schedule, preferred games, personalities, or gaming preferences.</div>
    <div>The first possible solution is to group people together based on what time of day they tend to play video games at. Each user would input an approximate 7 day schedule for when they play games, and then the app would match people together with similar schedules.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image1.png" width="600" height="400" alt="p1 (solution 1)">
    <div>The user can first select the applicable days of the week for their schedule. Then they may individually click or click and drag over the ovals representing their active hours. If the user wishes to have multiple schedules, they can create a alternate schedules for other days of the week by clicking the “Add another schedule…” button.</div>
    <div>Another possible solution would be to match people based on what games they like to play. Each user would select a list of game genres or specific games they like and rank each choice based on their preferences.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image2.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="p2 (solution 2)">
    <div>“Select a genre by clicking it. You may resize a bubble by clicking and dragging. Larger bubbles indicate a greater preference.”</div>
    <div>This genre selection will appear on user’s profiles to be viewed by other users. The data will also be used by our algorithm to match users.</div>
    <div>Alternatively, one way that people could be matched together is through a personality quiz like MBTI. We could create an app that asks people a list of questions to determine what type of personality they have, and then use that data to match a person with someone who is similar to them.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image3.png" width="600" height="300" alt="p3 (16Personalities)">
    <div>Lastly, we could match people based on their preferences. Users would be prompted to answer questions by selecting a response. Further related preferences will be prompted based on the user’s previous selection.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image4.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="p4 (solution 4)">
    <div>The example shown above simulates a user who’s preference is to ‘Have Fun’, ‘Chat about Game Strategy’ and ‘Likes to play the role of Healer’. This data will be used by the algorithm to match similar players.</div>

    <div class="text_subheadings">User Research</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Participant Summary</div>
    <div>In total we interviewed 5 participants. Each one is laid out below.</div>
    <div>Participant 1, is an avid fighting game player who focuses mainly on Super Smash Bros Ultimate. They play against a lot of random people online, but don’t normally go out of their way to look for people to play with. They were recruited because they play a lot of online games. They helped our goal by giving us a perspective of someone who plays a lot of online games, but would benefit from it being easier to find people to play with online.</div>
    <div>Participant 2 is a business student. They are indifferent about meeting new people online compared to in-person. They often play video games online and are experienced at meeting new people using the application ‘Discord’; for this reason they were recruited for this study. As a frequent user of services similar to our project, they provided valuable insight into the objectives and priorities of a likely end-user.</div>
    <div>Participant 3 is a computer science student. They are a daily user of Discord. They find that they are much more likely to play a game if they have a companion. They use Discord because it is the best application currently available to them: they are likely to change platforms if a better service becomes available. They were selected as a participant for our study because they are an active member of our target demographic.</div>
    <div>Participant 4 is a young adult studying computer science. He thinks people on the internet are mostly nice, but still could run into someone who has a bad temper. He plays games a lot during vacation or on holidays and not as much during school or work days. He thinks playing games with friends is more fun than playing alone since he can chat with them about things other than just games. He mainly uses Discord, and thinks it is easy to use most of the time. One thing he doesn’t like about the platform is that sometimes users have to enter a few lines of code in order to use certain features, and this could be hard for new users or people who have zero coding experience. This could be improved by making more buttons for specific features.</div>
    <div>Participant 5 is a young adult who is studying finance. She thinks people on the internet are passionate overall, but from time to time she will be harassed by others. She likes to play games with friends because she feels lonely when playing alone. Playing games is also a profession for her, and being able to make money is another reason she likes to play with people. She uses an app called TTChat-Gamers’ Social Platform when playing games with other people. She hopes that the internet connection could be more stable since this is an app for gamers who need to respond very fast to others and take actions in game. She thinks it is unnecessary to pay any money in this app because it can only be used for playing games with other people. Further, she believes the app’s design is not very good since she must join a voice chat before she can learn about someone’s skill level and play style.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Research Methods</div>
    <div>Our research methods consisted of ethnographies and interviews. We chose ethnographies because solutions for finding people online already exist, Discord being the most popular service. Thus, we could easily observe our participants using solutions that already exist and record any issues they experienced.</div>
    <div>We chose to do interviews because in addition to ethnographies, we also wanted to get input into their interactions with people over the internet. This provided us with both generic and specific data about how each participant searches for people online.</div>
    <div>For the ethnography, we asked each participant to search for someone to join them in a game. Throughout the ethnography, we found that people would find companions by sending text messages to groups for individual games or asking friends one by one. All but one user immediately defaulted to using Discord for the ethnography. The process of individually messaging can be very time consuming with no guarantee that the user will find a person with whom they would like to play.  Every user was able to accomplish the task, by direct message or through visiting specific Discord servers. Most of the servers were intuitive, although few seemed difficult to navigate. We found that many users usually will not view the bottom of the page, so it is important to put crucial information at the top. Also, people have an easier time navigating through an interface if it is in their first language.</div>
    <div>For the interview, we found that people didn’t necessarily feel a strong allegiance towards any one app, but those that used Discord thought it was sufficient. This was surprising: we had expected Discord users to feel loyalty towards the program, but that was not the case. Primarily,  people like to use apps that their friends also use, but additionally place a large priority on applications that provide seamless online interactions. Users indicated that they might use an app to meet new people more if it had a simple and straightforward system that matched them with others automatically.</div>
    <div>Below is a list of what went well, what went poorly, what would we do differently next time.</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>We could have spent more time doing mock interviews on ourselves to polish the interview questions.</li>
        <li>The majority of participants used Discord during our ethnographies. This could be a sample size issue and Discord might not be used as broadly in our target audience as our data indicates.</li>
        <li>Some of our sub-questions seem to be asking the same thing with other questions.</li>
        <li>Some questions were answered by the participants prior to being asked.</li>
        <li>Our data size is optimum and valid.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Task descriptions</div>
    <div>Based on the data we collected we have come up with 4 key tasks of how we expect the system to be used.</div>
    <div>Task 1:</div>
    <div>Alex Jones is a young student looking to connect with people online. Alex is an experienced internet user. They have made friends online before.</div>
    <div>Alex wants to meet people with similar interests. They sign up for an online service that pairs users based on their compatibility. Alex customizes their profile to share their personality; their schedule availability between 7:00pm to 11:30pm; and their preference towards FPS, puzzle, and narrative games.</div>
    <div>Justification: The most crucial step for a new service is acquiring new users. Our interface prioritizes a seamless onboarding experience. We want user registration to be as brief as possible so the user can immediately engage with our service. We also want to allow users to customize and become attached to their profiles. This task is the fundamental basis for our service: it will be difficult to maintain every other objective without a stream of new users.</div>
    <div>Task 2:</div>
    <div>Mark Smith, who is a decently social and handcore gamer, is wanting to meet new people and make some friends. He searches for a random person who is also looking to play a game that he likes. He gets matched with a person and plays some games with them. After doing this with a few people, he finds one person that is really funny and spends the rest of his night playing with them. Mark is a first time user and has many games that he likes to play.</div>
    <div>Justification: This is the main goal that our interface would accomplish. This solves the main problem that we are working on, of people having trouble finding others to play with, in a quick and simple manner.</div>
    <div>Task 3:</div>
    <div>Katie Baker is fairly new to playing games, and is interested in meeting new people who share interests with her who can also help her learn how to play well. After meeting another, more experienced player who taught her many basic strategies, she has to stop playing. Before she goes, she adds the more experienced player to a friends list in the hopes of being able to gain more advice and play with them later.</div>
    <div>Justification: Meeting new people who might share an interest with you is the primary purpose of our platform, but it is unhelpful if the user cannot track the other person down at a later time. A friends list solves this issue – if both players like playing with each other, they can add each other to their friends lists and be able to find each other again.</div>
    <div>Task 4:</div>
    <div>John Doe is a young adult who spends a lot of time playing video games. He tried using discord to find people to play with, which went well at first. After a few days, something happened that made him become more and more reluctant to play that game. Which is, after he played a few games with certain people, he then realized that he doesn’t like to play them. But at this moment, those people really like to play with John and want to spend more time playing with him. John really wants to play the game, but he doesn’t know how to reject those game invites sent by those people he doesn’t like playing with. He feels awkward and just spends less time on that game. Until now, when he is using our interface, he can choose whether or not to reveal his personal profile to people he matched after spending some time playing with them. In the case where people revealed themselves to each other, they can then see each other’s profile and be able to send private messages. John enjoyed this feature a lot because he doesn’t have to keep playing with people he dislikes and also doesn’t need to think about how to reject those people.</div>
    <div>Justification: This is a very important feature our interface provides. This can avoid awkwardness when playing with strangers and also can make users feel comfortable and willing to use this interface.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Journey Maps</div>
    <div>Below we have created journey maps for each of our key tasks.</div>
    <div>Task 1:</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image5.png" width="600" height="400" alt="p5">
    <div>Task 2:</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image6.png" width="600" height="400" alt="p6">
    <div>Task 3:</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image7.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="p7">
    <div>Task 4:</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image8.png" width="600" height="400" alt="p8">
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Design Requirements</div>
    <div>Finally, after considering our user data, key tasks, and journey maps, we have come up with the following list of design requirements for our interface.</div>
    <div>Must do:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>Allow users to create their own secure account.</li>
        <li>Allow users to create profiles for themselves.</li>
        <li>Match users with random other users.</li>
        <li>Match users with other users who play the same games.</li>
        <li>Save a list of friends that a user enjoyed playing with.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Justification: These are the core functionalities that solve the problem we’re working on.</div><br>
    <div>Should do:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>Match users with other users who have similar schedules.</li>
        <li>Match users with other users by play style.</li>
        <li>Match users with other users who have specific experience levels.</li>
        <li>Save users from playing with other users they don’t like.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Justification: While not absolutely needed for a solution to our problem, these functions would enhance our solution immensely.</div><br>
    <div>Could do:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>Support advanced emojis and gifs in user to user messaging.</li>
        <li>Filter user to user chat dialogues of profanities.</li>
        <li>Support multiple different languages.</li>
        <li>Expand to support activities outside gaming.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Justification: These are extra improvements that would make our interface polished and diverse but are not needed for the core purpose.</div>

    <div class="text_subheadings">Low-Fidelity Prototyping with Heuristic Evaluation</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Brainstorm</div>
    <div>Our brainstorming session went well. We sketched out 17 different ideas, ranging from reasonable/interesting ideas to crazy/revolutionary concepts. Out of all of them, the most promising 3 ideas where the following:</div>
    <div>What the screen could look like when you are matched with someone.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image9.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="p9">
    <div>What the profile creation process could look like. This is the scheduling setting screen.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image10.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="p10">
    <div>How we should keep people private until they want to show themselves in a voice call.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image11.jpg" width="500" height="800" alt="p11">
    <div>Of the 17 ideas we came up with, we grouped them into 4 categories: Solid Ideas, Interesting Possible Ideas, Profile Creation Ideas, and Zany Ideas.</div><br>
    <div>The solid ideas consisted of practical ideas that we thought we could use in our app. These ideas included the following:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>A UI screen for a friends list.</li>
        <li>Keeping people private in voice calls.</li>
        <li>A UI screen for what it could look like when you get a match.</li>
        <li>If we made this a Discord plugin, where people would find it in Discord.</li>
        <li>Connecting peoples steam accounts to our app to auto add their steam games to their profiles.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>The interesting possible ideas were cool ideas that had a lot of promise, but that we don’t think we will actually add to our system. These ideas included the following:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>Adding an impressive moments tab to showcase the coolest moments that people have had while playing games with people they found on our app.</li>
        <li>Making our whole application a single server in Discord with a bot that does everything from putting people in voice chats to profile creation.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>The profile creation ideas were ideas that centered around how we might set up our profile system. These ideas included the following:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>The UI for how people could set what hours of the week they are free.</li>
        <li>How people could edit the exact times they are free.</li>
        <li>The UI screen for setting up their username and password.</li>
        <li>The UI for selecting people’s favorite games.</li>
        <li>Suggesting games to add to their favorite games based on their playtime.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>Finally, the zany ideas were a group of a wacky proposals that are unique in some way, but not realistic. These ideas included the following:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>Forcing people to meet up in person at a local internet cafe.</li>
        <li>People could rate each other after they play together.</li>
        <li>Charging people a monthly subscription to get increased profile rating and more choice of matches.</li>
        <li>Making our app a phone app that only supports text and voice chat.</li>
        <li>Change people’s mean text messages into positive ones.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>As you can see we had a good variety of ideas. We chose the most promising idea by thinking of which things our app definitely needs and which of our ideas seemed to fit that the most closely. In the end we decided that profile creation was really important, so we picked our favorite profile creation idea to expand for our video prototype. Then matching people together is also quite important, so we expanded the matched with person UI screen idea to make our storyboard.</div>
    <div>The main related work that we discussed was Discord. As many of our participants in assignment 2 used Discord, we have noticed some people are having difficulties or not happy with some designs when using it. With that in mind, we have come up with some ideas which would make certain aspects of our interface better than Discord. The key differences between our ideas and Discord include the following:</div>
    <ul class="list_items">
        <li>The idea of a matching system makes the process of finding someone to play games with way easier with our interface.</li>
        <li>The idea of hiding personal information until the user chooses to reveal themself gives users more privacy and comfort and also makes our interface more discreet.</li>
        <li>The idea of time selection with our interface gives users more flexibility over Discord, also it will prevent other people from bothering you to play while you are busy at that moment.</li>
        <li>The idea of quick introduction (the bullet points that show one user’s playstyle, wanted role, goal, other interests, etc. to other users) will let users know each other a lot faster and it also encourages conversation.</li>
        <li>The idea of a simple design can make users use it in ease.</li>
        <li>The idea of connecting to users’ steam accounts with a background data analysis could filter out the users that would have a bigger chance to get along with each other. </li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>The brainstorm and discussion process was very interesting. At first, each of us came up with 3-5 ideas that are good and useful in our own perspectives. Then when we put all our ideas together, the process of selecting certain ideas that all members like worked very well. The part that was difficult and cost us a lot of time was debating why some of us disagree with other people’s ideas and why those ideas should not be put to practice. It is very normal that people like their own ideas and feel those ideas should be selected; however, in a bigger picture, some of the ideas are actually not that good. Thus during our discussion, all the convincing, explanation, persuasion going around cost a lot of time and also it was tiring. It was all about whether someone has enough to back up their idea and convince others or if not, convinced by others. Although this process was difficult and time consuming, it was also very effective and productive. Because of this process, we could finally come up with some great ideas. After we have decided which ideas are great, we all brainstormed together to see if we can come up with greater ideas. The way we did the group brainstorm was first someone came up with a simple thought, then if other people find it interesting they could all build their own ideas upon that thought until all members are satisfied with the final idea. Next time, we should reserve more time for our meeting since we went overtime for both of our brainstorming and discussion sessions. Also, it would be more effective if we were discussing in person rather than online voice calls. This brainstorm and discussion process was very fun, we all enjoyed it a lot.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Storyboard & Video Prototype</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image12.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="p12">
    <div>The storyboard illustrates the journey of a user searching for a teammate and being connected to a user with shared interests. The top left image is the initialization step. A single button, ‘Find Person’ is offered. Below it is a checkbox that toggles entering voice communication when a match is made. The top right image is the loading screen provided after the user presses the ‘Find Person’ button. We feature a loading bar in the form of a circle growing incrementally with each tick. If a match has not been found by the time the circle completes, it will begin decrementing the circle. There is an option to cancel the search by clicking the ‘X’ in the top left corner. The moment a match is made, we move to the image in the bottom left. In this episode, we can view a few details about the person we were matched with: we see their username and our shared interests. We can also return home or search for someone new by clicking their corresponding buttons.The final image is the end of this use case, we have connected the two parties and they have been connected in a voice chat. In this interface, we can see their avatar and have two buttons: one to end the call and the other to enable direct messaging between participants.</div>
    <video controls="controls" src="video/Video%20Prototype_no_sound_edit.mp4" width="800" height="600">Your browser does not support this Video.</video>
    <div>The video prototype demonstrates a user customizing their profile by setting their schedule and selecting the games they wish to play. This task is vital to our service as our matchmaking relies entirely on coordinated schedules and matching games.</div>
    <div>The video starts on the basic information page. From this page, we navigate to the scheduling section by clicking the ‘Schedule’ button on the left. The user then selects their schedule by selecting the weekday hours when they are available. Our user selects the timeframe of 18:00-23:00. The user does this by individually selecting each oval, representing an hour of time. The user next selects the weekend hours they are available.  In this example, we demonstrate the ability to click-and-drag their cursor over the ovals to select their hours. On the weekend, our user indicates they are available to play between the hours of 09:00-18:00. Next, the user clicks the ‘Games’ button on the left. They are prompted to select a variety of games based on the game’s popularity. For the purpose of this prototype, only 4 games are included in the demo. In the demo, our user selects ‘Game 2’ and then later selects ‘Game 3’. These buttons are coloured to indicate they have been selected. The user then clicks the ‘Save’ button at the bottom to save their information.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Heuristic Evaluation</div>
    <div>Results: describe your heuristic evaluation results with justifications and reflect on the process – what went well, what went poorly, and would you do differently another time.</div>
    <div>The results of our heuristic evaluation were mixed – in most areas we did reasonably well, but there were a few sections that we realized could use a lot of work. These problematic areas relate primarily to the ninth and tenth heuristics – error recognition, diagnosis, and recovery as well as documentation. The primary problem with the ninth heuristic was specifically error recognition on the scheduling page. The buttons that controlled setting the schedule were small and grouped in such a way that a user could easily accidentally set or missed setting a specific hour as part of their timetable, and our group deemed this to be a notable problem that should be focused upon improving for the next prototype. The other major issue, linked to help and documentation, the tenth heuristic, was that there was almost no aid provided to the user to help them understand the functionality of the system, and almost all of the existing aid was in the form of feedback to user actions.</div>
    <div>There were many other, less serious heuristic violations that were noted – there is little correlation between many portions of the system’s UI and anything a user might encounter in the physical world. Another violation is that especially considering the scheduling interface, it is easy to make an error as the buttons are relatively tightly packed. This is also part of the reason the violation of the ninth heuristic mentioned above is so problematic – it is easy to make a mistake and hard to notice that you have made said mistake. Other issues include a difficulty in using the scheduling interface if your schedule is complicated. Inputting a complex schedule could become extremely difficult to do if you have multiple smaller blocks of time throughout the day you can play in instead of a few larger blocks. Further, the interface above cannot handle time slots that don’t start and end on an exact hour or allow users to have different schedules for different specific days. Despite this, however, the interface has its basic functionality which is why our group decided this heuristic was not violated as seriously. Overall, we believe the project and its heuristic evaluation went well, though in hindsight we should have put more attention towards allowing the user to recognize any errors made as well as providing more aid to the user.</div>

    <div class="text_subheadings">Medium-Fidelity Prototyping</div>
    <video controls="controls" src="video/Party%20Finder%20Prototype.mp4" width="800" height="600">Your browser does not support this Video.</video>
    <div>Our prototype accomplishes two key tasks: Creation of an Account and Matching with Another User. We demonstrate this by allowing users to create their profile, input their details, schedule, and preferred games. We also have prototyped the matching service, which will connect users based on their preferences.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Prototype Task 1: Creation of an Account</div>
    <div>The design requirements we identified during our interviews and ethnographies directed us towards developing interfaces that required as little input from the user as possible. Our users indicated that they wanted a low barrier-to-entry and we designed our user intake to reflect that. The scheduling interface has been created to allow users to easily select the hours in which they are available. Users may click or click-and-drag over the ovals, each representing an hour, to select the hours of the day that they wish to play a game. We received feedback in the most recent lab when we invited participants to experiment with our prototype. Some users said that they struggled to identify which ovals represented which hours, so we adjusted our prototype to accommodate this feedback. The game selection interface prompts users to select the games which they would like to play. For ease of access, we suggest the most popular games to the user; once a few games have been selected, we aim to adapt our algorithm to suggest games similar to the ones already selected. When we consulted users, they said that they would much prefer to select games from a provided list rather than remember and recall specific games themselves, although we do provide a function to search by title should the user choose to do so. </div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Prototype Task 2: Matching Users</div>
    <div>We have created three interfaces for matching users: the ‘Begin Matching’ interface, the ‘Searching…’ interface, and the connected user interface. Intuitive design was a primary objective of ours, we wanted the interface to speak for itself. To accomplish this, we focused on using a colour scheme of blue hues and gray. Our initial interface, the ‘Begin Matching’ screen, starts us with our logo with a gray background. We explicitly made this decision to indicate to the user that no matching is currently active. We reinforce this understanding by colouring every ‘Cancel’ or ‘Disconnect’ button in the same gray. Upon clicking the blue ‘Begin Matching’ button, the interface changes to show our logo pulsing with a blue background. We designed the pulse to tell the user that the process is still searching for a match and the program has not frozen. Blue was selected as our active colour, every blue button is a proactive choice we are suggesting our user to experiment with. As such, when the program begins to search for a match, it changes the gray background into a blue background. Similarly, the option to ‘Use Voice Chat’ is shown in blue to indicate it is intractable. Once the program matches two users, we are shown their username, their shared interests, a ‘Start Chatting!’ button and a ‘Disconnect’ button. We highlight their shared interests in a blue text, as these are active decisions the user made to select these games. The system text, which is non-intractable, is shown in black. This is the final phase of the matching task, with the user able to select the active, blue ‘Start Chatting!’ button or decline by pressing the gray ‘Disconnect’ button. </div>
    <div class="text_subheadings">Evaluation plan</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">What is the goal for the user-evaluation?</div>
    <div>Since we are designing an interface that matches people together, we must be very careful on how we want them to be matched. The accuracy and matching speed/algorithm will directly affect the successfulness of our interface. Thus, the user profile creation design is a critical part of our interface. We must gather as much information as we can and the questions must be as accurately and related as possible to their gaming preferences when the user is creating the profile, but at the same time we can not make them feel overwhelmed or offended. Surely we will do the best we can to make a good design. But as developers, we certainly can not view this from all aspects and will probably make some mistakes. With that being said, our goal for the user-evaluation would be to gather ideas and advice about our profile creation and matching system from different groups of people so we can improve the effectiveness and satisfaction of our design to be more acceptable by future users. Our goal would also include fixing issues/bugs/errors we have not noticed before to improve integrity of our interface.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">What evaluation method(s) will you employ and why do you think those methods are appropriate?</div>
    <div>The first evaluation method is Moderated Usability Testing. We will recruit some candidates with different cultural backgrounds, major, gender, and ethnicity to conduct our study.The reason why we chose this method is because it is the simplest and most straightforward way to collect useful feedback from different groups of users. There is no method that can be more efficient to get user experience other than actually letting them use the prototype to complete some task on their own. The second evaluation method we are going to employ is Interview. The interview questions would be based on social media and online interactions. We feel this method is appropriate for our project because it could not only provide us with a lot of good new ideas for our design, but also make us aware of how a bad design would look like. Also with the wide range of variety of our candidates, the data we collected from these interviews is valid to represent most of possible future users. Between the feedback and the test results, we can furthermore improve the fidelity of our interface.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">How will you go about a single evaluation session – what are the steps?</div>
    <div>For a single evaluation session, the steps will be as follows:</div>
    <ul class="list_steps">
        <li>Send the consent form to the candidate</li>
        <li>Let the candidate be aware of situation and move on if the candidate agree to the terms</li>
        <li>Send our medium fidelity prototype to the candidate for testing</li>
        <li>Ask the candidate to share his/her screen if ready</li>
        <li>Give the candidate one or two tasks and ask them to try to achieve the goal by himself/herself while using our prototype. </li>
        <li>Record the screen while the candidate is using our prototype to complete the task(s) and take notes if necessary</li>
        <li>When the candidate have reached the goal or is confused and does not know what to do next without reaching the goal, ask them to stop the process</li>
        <li>Ask the candidate a few question about his/her experience, thought or advice</li>
        <li>Record the answers with text</li>
        <li>Thank the candidate for doing the test</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>While conducting the evaluation session, the inspector must remain neutral all the time and keep the conversation minimum to only what is necessary.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Are there certain problems or challenges you anticipate? </div>
    <div>There are several problems that we have anticipated potentially occurring. These challenges include:</div>
    <ul class="list_steps">
        <li>A lack of quantitative data obtained during the evaluation process</li>
        <li>The qualitative data obtained being vague</li>
        <li>Directly contradicting data and feedback across different candidates</li>
        <li>Candidates not understanding or otherwise misinterpreting elements of the interface</li>
        <li>Candidates acting informally, and these actions altering their experience performing a task, the time it takes to perform a task not being accurate as a result</li>
        <li>Candidates not giving fully honest feedback due to the existing relationship between them and the evaluator</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Do you have remedies for those problems? </div>
    <div>Some of the above problems we have remedies for or ways to mitigate the impact they have on the final data set. One, candidates not understanding or otherwise misinterpreting elements of the interface is one of the things we are explicitly looking for, as where and why it occurs is a major aspect of this study. Candidates intentionally or otherwise altering the data gained is not a problem we can fix, and is difficult to mitigate without unduly influencing the candidate – emphasizing at the beginning that this is a formal project we are looking for honest feedback about is the current method for attempting to prevent this. The data we receive being mostly qualitative and vague is largely inevitable, given we are evaluating an interface – aesthetics and intuitiveness are the major parts of it, and both are inherently subjective. Requesting descriptive feedback during the interview as well as inviting and recording the candidates’ commentary during the testing are the two methods we have taken to attempt to make the qualitative data as understandable and concrete as possible given the difficulties in obtaining unambiguous quantitative data. These methods also help to minimize directly contradictory data across candidates – encouraging specificity and elaboration allows for surface level discrepancies while having deeper similarities which we can then address.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">What kinds of data do you want to collect?</div>
    <div>We want to collect video data as well as Q&As data. The video data should be all about the candidates using our prototype to complete some task on their own. This kind of data could help us detect even the slightest hesitation or their habits while using our prototype by simply slowing the video and repeatedly watching it. For example, the movement of the cursor itself could tell us a lot of information on how we can make improvements. So the merit for video data is we can review the actual candidates’ actions again and again with any speed we want, and we might get new insights every time watching it. The Q&As data is the most basic but also most widely used and effective data type. This kind of data is very intuitive and easy to comprehend by both interviewer and interviewee. Since Q&As data is very straightforward, we can notice any flaws or improvements that need to be made and optimize our interface in a short time period.</div>
    <div class="text_subheadings">Final Evaluation with Users</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Description</div>
    <div>The study of our medium fidelity prototype was conducted by having each of our participants complete two tasks with the prototype (creating a profile and matching with a random person), then answer some questions about their experience afterwards. However, before we could do our user testing, we did a pilot study to test our research plan. The pilot went quite well. We got one of our classmates to go through our study as if they were a participant, and we asked them some questions afterwards. The major thing we observed was that they didn’t think that setting their schedule and picking games was part of the create a profile task. To fix this, we added a note to our study plan to prompt our participants to do this if needed. Additionally, they were confused about all the buttons of the sidebar, about how to get to the matchmaking page, and a few other things. We noted these issues down to keep in mind for when we make improvements to the prototype later.</div>
    <div>Now that the pilot study was completed, we moved on to doing the usability testing with our actual participants. We had 10 total participants all of whom were around the age of a young adult. We recruited people who we thought could be real users of our app, so all our participants play video games and are somewhat online and social people.</div>
    <div>When conducting our evaluations, we used remote moderated testing and interviews. We voice called with our participants, sent them a link to run our prototype, then asked them to complete each of our tasks one by one. Once finished, we interviewed each participant about their experience with the app. We video and voice recorded the participant’s screen and answers to questions (with consent) and analyzed the data afterwards. We chose to do remote testing because it was simpler to coordinate, and we didn’t need any real world data to conduct our study. We were able to get all the information we needed by watching our participant’s screens and asking them questions afterwards. Additionally, we wanted to be able to help our users if they got stuck, so we decided to do a moderated study rather than unmoderated. Finally, we chose to do an interview after testing the prototype to get more general feedback about the app that we wouldn’t get if we only watched them use it.</div>
    <div>Below are two images of participants using our prototype.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image13.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="p13">
    <div>A user setting their schedule.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image14.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="p14">
    <div>A user matching with a random person.</div>
    <div>We collected data from both the testing and interview. In the testing, we observed what each participant did, and what they struggled with. We then analyzed this data by discussing which problems seemed to come up most often. For the interview, we asked them to rate how easy the app was to use, and their overall experience on a scale from 1 to 10. We then also asked them what improvements they thought the app needed, and what they liked and disliked about the interface. This gave us a lot of qualitative data that we analyzed by reasoning and aggregating the data into common groups.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Results</div>
    <div>With the data we have collected from Moderated Usability Testing and Interview with 10 users, the result can be categorized into three main subdivisions: functionality, design, and rating. Our data was created by asking each participant to complete two tasks: 1. Create a profile; 2. Match with another player.  Functionality wise, users wished they were able to choose a schedule time for every single day instead of only for weekdays and weekends. Some users suggested that we add a filter to allow users to be able to match with a gender and region of their choice. For the profile creation, users suggested that we should add a function to make sure the user inputs are formatted correctly – email, phone number, etc. When we were conducting the studies, one user did not save after making changes to the personal profile, causing that person to lose all the changes made.That user felt a little bit frustrated and said: “Shoot! forgot to save it. It should remind me to save when I was going to another page.”</div>
    <div>Design wise, we found out that a lot of users love dark mode which we have not yet implemented, but could improve user experience once we do. When the users were being asked to complete Task 2 – match with someone, more than half of them spent some time searching  or could not complete the task. We noticed that users only discovered that the top left button navigates them to a matching screen  when they tried testing every button. Users were not 100% sure whether they clicked on the right button or not until they had actually clicked on it.. When the users were being asked to complete Task 1 – create a profile, almost all users thought setting a schedule and picking the games are not part of profile creation. One user suggested we could add a sign up page instead of going to profile making  page directly after clicking on sign up. Also, participants suggested that it would be better if we add some fade-in pop-up windows with a description above the cursor when hovering over some icons/fields so the user can have more control over the interface (Recognition rather than recall). Another suggestion was adding some background images for each game in the Games page and to show the name of the game being played on the matching screen.</div>
    <div>We asked all the users to give a rating for ‘Ease of Use’ and ‘Overall Experience’. After we put the numbers together, our interface got an average of a 6.45/10 for ease of use and a 6/10 for overall experience. We got some positive feedback as well as some negative feedback from the users. Mostly, the users like our interface since it is easy and simple to use. Also one mentioned that the interface feels polished and “It doesn’t make me angry”, which described their experience. One user said: “I like it since there are not too many things going on at the same time which is good because the user can focus on the task at hand.” Also some other users mentioned that they love the matching mechanism since it is fast. As for the negative feedback, one user is concerned about being stalked by strangers. A lot of users feel some functionalities are not well explained and need to be more intuitive. Many users are feeling the schedule page is too crowded; however, some users felt the schedule page is actually well designed. Aesthetically, users felt clean and nice but somewhat sparse. After the study one user said: “I think what is in it so far is well done”, and most of the users felt the same way.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Discussion</div>
    <div>The usability testing provided valuable insights into the design of our prototype. In regards to functionality, our users suggested excellent changes that we can make moving forward with our app development. Many users commented on creating schedules for specific days, rather than a broad ‘weekday’ or ‘weekend’ category. This is a change that we will make moving forward. Further, many users found themselves forgetting to save their schedule after setting it, frustrating them and removing their progress. A change to auto-save user’s progress will be implemented as it will be an excellent example of the Error Prevention heuristic. Another Error Prevention functionality we would like to implement is user-input checking during the sign-up process. By asking a user to enter their email and password twice, we would greatly decrease the likelihood a user is prone to a ‘slip’ during the sign-up process. The majority of the changes we will be making is to the design of our interface. Many of the changes suggested by users were entirely aesthetic-related and are easily adjusted, recommendations such as a dark mode, colour preferences, etc. The major changes we wish to target are design choices that directly impact the quality of our service. Such a change will be to our scheduling screen.</div>
    <img src="img/Party%20Finder/image15.png" width="800" height="500" alt="p15">
    <div>Users found it strenuous to determine which hour corresponds to which oval. Similarly, users indicated that there was too much space between each individual oval, so much so that even users that intuitively knew to click-and-drag (Efficiency of use heuristic) had difficulties using the functionality. To remedy this, we will be researching better avenues to display and schedule this information: we want to create an interface that is both easy to recognize and simple to use. Similarly, we want to streamline the transition between the profile setup (setting games and schedule) and matching with another user. A large portion of the feedback we received was that it was unclear how to begin searching for other users, the main functionality of our program. This is a crucial issue, a smooth transition for our users to quickly find a match is essential to our mission. To address this shortcoming, we need to re-evaluate our interface: what can we change to make this avenue easier for users to identify. A potential change that we are considering is creating a tutorial that guides a new user through the interface, telling them which fields they must complete and then directing them and teaching them about each core functionality.</div>
    <div>We will need to resolve each of our prototype’s flaws by revisiting the design phase of the development cycle. The primary focus of our redesign will focus on design choices that negatively affected our user’s experience, namely deficiencies in intuitive design and navigation through our application. Upon completion of these goals we will begin again to add new functionalities to our current framework.</div>
    <div class="text_stepheadings">Limitations and Reflections</div>
    <div>Our study has a few limitations, the most notable of which is the lack of diversity in participants. We only recruited people we had a prior connection to, and even then we only recruited people who were legally adults. While the young adults we asked to test our prototype are part of our intended userbase, they only represent a piece of it – teenagers are also a demographic we expect to use our interface, and they are not represented at all in our group of participants. Another flaw in the makeup of our testing group is that they were, with only a couple exceptions, male – while we cannot see why that might impact the feedback significantly, it is still a flaw as we have no way of being certain about how that may skew the results. Another, related issue is since all of the participants had prior relationships with our team’s members, the feedback and ratings they have might have been influenced by that prior connection whether the alterations to the data were conscious decisions on their part or not. The method we used to monitor and record the testers’ actions, an online zoom call, also introduced a notable limitation to the study: not being able to properly evaluate the participants’ body language. While we attempted to draw conclusions on their thought processes from their actions, words, and their responses to the interview afterwards, even those three fields combined could not give a full picture of how the participant felt and how they thought throughout the actual testing. Lastly, the very incomplete state of our prototype, with many buttons that did not and were not intended to function altered some of the feedback we received from the testers; there were many comments about the unfinished state of the prototype in the results we received, and the testers noticing this could have impacted other feedback they gave.</div>
    <div>We learned many things through this study, especially involving designing future prototypes. The most notable problem we encountered was participants attempting to use  buttons that were not implemented as part of the prototype because they weren’t relevant to the task we presented to the testers, and instead of realizing that they must not be relevant to the task and thus not implemented, they jumped to believing that the prototype wasn’t working properly. This suggests improvements that could be made on two fronts, the first and most notable of which is enhancing clarity. If participants figured out what each button was supposed to do, this situation likely would not have occurred in the first place. Secondly, in the case where a tester clicks on the unimplemented buttons anyway, we need to make it clear that the lack of functionality is not an error, the button or feature is merely not intended to work in the prototype we have given them. Most of the other major limitations we encountered in the study can be addressed by encouraging a greater diversity in the various qualities of the participants – age and gender being the main areas we should diversify in future moderated tests. Lastly, if future evaluations were also online there would ideally be two cameras recording instead of the single one we used – this would allow us to see the participants completely and see their physical reactions to what they are doing. This monitoring of the actual person on the other side could give even more information on how users feel when they interact with the prototype. Recording their face might lead to privacy issues and the implications would have to be carefully considered, but the data and additional context that would be gained could help increase the effective feedback we receive in future studies immensely.</div>
